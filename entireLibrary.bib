  abstract  = {Computational modelling of audio systems commonly involves discretising lumped models. The properties of common discretisation schemes are typically derived through analysis of how the imaginary axis on the Laplace-transform s-plane maps onto the Ztransform z-plane and the implied stability regions. This analysis ignores some important considerations regarding the mapping of individual poles, in particular the case of highly-damped poles. In this paper, we analyse the properties of an extended class of discretisations based on Möbius transforms, both as mappings and discretisation schemes. We analyse and extend the concept of frequency warping, well-known in the context of the bilinear transform, and we characterise the relationship between the damping and frequencies of poles in the sand z-planes. We present and analyse several design criteria (damping monotonicity, stability) corresponding to desirable properties of the discretised system. Satisfying these criteria involves selecting appropriate transforms based on the pole structure of the system on the s-plane. These theoretical developments are finally illustrated on a diode clipper nonlinear model.},

  abstract  = {This study examined the control of a planar two-link robot arm. The control approach design was based on the dynamic model of the robot. The mathematical model of the system was nonlinear, and thus a feedback linearization control was first proposed to obtain a linear system for which a model predictive control (MPC) was developed. The MPC control parameters were obtained analytically by minimizing a cost function. In addition, a simulation study was done comparing the proposed MPC control approach, the linear quadratic (LQ) control based on the same feedback linearization, and a control approach proposed in the literature for the same problem. The results showed the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the success of the Koopman operator in dynamical systems analysis has also fueled the development of Koopman operator-based control frameworks. In order to preserve the relatively low data requirements for an approximation via Dynamic Mode Decomposition, a quantization approach was recently proposed in [1]. This way, control of nonlinear dynamical systems can be realized by means of switched systems techniques, using only a finite set of autonomous Koopman operatorbased reduced models. These individual systems can be approximated very efficiently from data. The main idea is to transform a control system into a set of autonomous systems for which the optimal switching sequence has to be computed. In this article, we extend these results to continuous control inputs using relaxation. This way, we combine the advantages of the data efficiency of approximating a finite set of autonomous systems with continuous controls. We show that when using the Koopman generator, this relaxation-realized by linear interpolation between two operators-does not introduce any error for control affine systems. This allows us to control high-dimensional nonlinear systems using bilinear, low-dimensional surrogate models. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated using several examples with increasing complexity, from the Duffing oscillator to the chaotic fluidic pinball.},

  abstract  = {We present a technique for describing the global behavior of complex, nonlinear flows, by decomposing the flow into modes determined from spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional linear operator associated with the full nonlinear system. These modes, referred to as Koopman modes, are associated with a particular observable, and may be determined directly from data (either numerical or experimental) using a variant of a standard Arnoldi method. They have an associated temporal frequency and growth rate and may be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of global eigenmodes of a linearized system. They provide an alternative to Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, and in the case of periodic data the Koopman modes reduce to a discrete temporal Fourier transform. The Arnoldi method used for computations is identical to the Dynamic Mode Decomposition recently proposed by Schmid & Sesterhenn (2008), so Dynamic Mode Decomposition can be thought of as an algorithm for finding Koopman modes. We illustrate the method on an example of a jet in crossflow, and show that the method captures the dominant frequencies and elucidates the associated spatial structures.},

This approach relies on a floating frame description and is valid under the assumption of small deformations. This allows including mechanical models that cannot be easily formulated in terms of differential forms. Once a pH model is established, a finite element based method is then introduced to discretize the dynamics in a structure-preserving manner.

Next, we develop a data-driven generalized balanced truncation method that relies on two steps. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions such that systems explaining the data have common generalized Gramians. Second, these common generalized Gramians are used to construct projection matrices that allow to characterize a class of reduced-order models via generalized balanced truncation in terms of a lower-dimensional QMI by applying the data reductionconcept. Additionally, we present alternative procedures to compute a priori and a posteriori upper bounds with respect to the true system generating the data.

SCRIMP notably relies on the FEniCS open-source computing platform for the finite element spatial discretization. Finally, we illustrate how to solve the considered model problems within this framework by carefully explaining the methodology. As additional support, companion interactive Jupyter notebooks are available.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we envision how to tackle a particularly challenging problem which presents highly interdisciplinary features, ranging from biology to engineering: the dynamic description and technological realisation of flapping flight. This document explains why, in order to gain new insights into this topic, we chose to employ port-{H}amiltonian theory. We discuss how the physically unifying character of the framework is able to describe flapping dynamics in all its important aspects. The technological and theoretical challenges of flapping flight are discussed by considering the interplay between different topics. First of all, the formal conceptualisation of the problem is analysed. Second, the features and capabilities of port-{H}amiltonian framework as the underneath mathematical language are presented. Subsequently, the discretisation of the resulting model by means of structure-preserving strategies is addressed. Once a reliable numerical model is available, we discuss how control actions can be computed based on high-level specifications aiming at increasing the flight performances. In the last part, the technological tools needed to validate experimentally the models and to equip a robotic bird prototype with the necessary sensing and actuation devices are discussed.},

In airplanes, for example, these coupled vibrations can lead to structural fatigue, noise and even instability. At ISAE, we have an experimental device that consists of a cantilevered plate with a fluid tank near the free tip. This device is being used for model validation and active control studies. This work uses the port-{H}amiltonian systems formulation for modeling this experimental device. Structural dynamics and fluid dynamics are independently modeled as infinite-dimensional systems. The plate is approximated as a beam. Shallow water equations are used for representing the fluid in the moving tank.

  abstract  = {This paper entails the application of the energy shaping methodology to control a flexible, elastic Cosserat rod model. Recent interest in such continuum models stems from applications in soft robotics, and from the growing recognition of the role of mechanics and embodiment in biological control strategies: octopuses are often regarded as iconic examples of this interplay. The dynamics of the Cosserat rod, here modeling a single octopus arm, are treated as a {H}amiltonian system and the internal muscle actuators are modeled as distributed forces and couples. The proposed energy shaping control design procedure involves two steps: (1) a potential energy is designed such that its minimizer is the desired equilibrium configuration; (2) an energy shaping control law is implemented to reach the desired equilibrium. By interpreting the controlled {H}amiltonian as a Lyapunov function, asymptotic stability of the equilibrium configuration is deduced. The energy shaping control law is shown to require only the deformations of the equilibrium configuration. A forward-backward algorithm is proposed to compute these deformations in an online iterative manner. The overall control design methodology is implemented and demonstrated in a dynamic simulation environment. Results of several bio-inspired numerical experiments involving the control of octopus arms are reported.},

  abstract  = {Soft pneumatic actuators are very popular in the soft robotic community due to their ease of manufacturing and simplicity of control. Currently, the efficiency of such soft actuators and their ability to do useful work are rarely investigated in a formal approach. The lack of task-orientated development approaches presents a barrier to utilize soft robotic systems in our everyday lives. In this paper, we describe an experimental approach based on port-{H}amiltonian theory applied on a type of pneumatic network (pneu-net) actuator to investigate the efficiency of task-orientated work. We can obtain efficiency from the external interactions of the port-{H}amiltonian system. If we can minimize the internal energy interactions, then the power continuous nature of the port-{H}amiltonian structure ensures more input energy will result in more useful work done at the output. We found out that higher efficiency actuators can be achieved with a softer material and a thinner wall thickness in the desired direction of the deformation. The internal mechanical energy storage is reduced as a result. However, if the task requires a higher work-done then a stiffer material is required. We can start to define a design approach based on the task. The task can be generalized in terms of energy. We can select the material properties suitable for the magnitude of work done. We can design the geometry to minimize the internal energy stored. The empirical model of the port-{H}amiltonian structure provides insights into how the mechanical efficiency varies in terms of design parameters and the port-{H}amiltonian approach is a step towards more practical, task-orientated soft robotic systems.},

  abstract  = {Soft continuum manipulators are characterized by low stiffness which allows safe operation in unstructured environments but introduces under-actuation. In addition, soft materials such as silicone rubber, which are commonly used for soft manipulators, are characterized by nonlinear stiffness, while pneumatic actuation can result in nonlinear damping. Consequently, achieving accurate control of these systems in the presence of disturbances is a challenging task. This paper investigates the model-based adaptive control for soft continuum manipulators that have nonlinear uniform stiffness and nonlinear damping, that bend under the effect of internal pressure, and that are subject to time-varying disturbances. A rigid-link model with virtual elastic joints is employed for control purposes within the port-{H}amiltonian framework. The effects of disturbances and of model uncertainties are estimated adaptively. A nonlinear controller that regulates the tip orientation of the manipulator and that compensates the effects of disturbances and of model uncertainties is then constructed by using an energy shaping passivity-based approach. Stability conditions are discussed highlighting the beneficial role of nonlinear damping. The effectiveness of the controller is assessed with simulations and with experiments on a soft continuum manipulator prototype.},

For some choices of parameters, the lines of fixed points along both the largest and smallest moment of inertia axes can be simultaneously attracting. Limiting cases are those that conserve either the energy or the magnitude of the angular momentum.

This research is part of a wider activity carried out in collaboration with Tetra Pak concerning the modelling and simulation of the Ultrasonic Sealing System (USTS). Due to the presence of a Compact Transducer (CT) that can be modelled only by means of commercial finite element CAE software, which provide extremely high-order dynamical systems, it is not possible to perform a simulation of the complete system to test the validity of the controller and perform the diagnosis of the sealing process in detail. The proposed procedure drastically reduces the simulation time without loosing the essential dynamical information. The model reduction algorithm is validated, at first, by means of a simple benchmark (a beam with a pair of piezo-electric actuators on both sides) and then applied to one piezo-electric actuator of the CT. The application to the whole system is still under development.},

  abstract      = {This work proposes an adaptive structure-preserving model order reduction method for finite-dimensional parametrized {H}amiltonian systems modeling non-dissipative phenomena. To overcome the slowly decaying Kolmogorov width typical of transport problems, the full model is approximated on local reduced spaces that are adapted in time using dynamical low-rank approximation techniques. The reduced dynamics is prescribed by approximating the symplectic projection of the {H}amiltonian vector field in the tangent space to the local reduced space. This ensures that the canonical symplectic structure of the {H}amiltonian dynamics is preserved during the reduction. In addition, accurate approximations with low-rank reduced solutions are obtained by allowing the dimension of the reduced space to change during the time evolution. Whenever the quality of the reduced solution, assessed via an error indicator, is not satisfactory, the reduced basis is augmented in the parameter direction that is worst approximated by the current basis. Extensive numerical tests involving wave interactions, nonlinear transport problems, and the Vlasov equation demonstrate the superior stability properties and considerable runtime speedups of the proposed method as compared to global and traditional reduced basis approaches.},

(ii) The geometric approximation of the Stokes-Dirac structure by a finite-dimensional Dirac structure is realized using a mixed Galerkin approach and power-preserving linear maps, which define minimal discrete power variables. (iii) With a consistent approximation of the {H}amiltonian, we obtain finite-dimensional port-{H}amiltonian state space models. By the degrees of freedom in the powerpreserving maps, the resulting family of structure-preserving schemes allows for trade-offs between centered approximations and upwinding.

We demonstrate that this framework provides a means of deriving discrete Lagrange-Dirac and nonholonomic {H}amiltonian systems.

After the dpH model of the beam is introduced, the control problem is discussed. In particular, it is shown how control approaches already presented in the literature can be unified, and a new control methodology is presented and discussed. This control methodology relies on the generalization to infinite dimensions of the concept of structural invariant (Casimir function) and on the extension to distributed systems of the so-called control by interconnection methodology. In this way, finite dimensional passive controllers can stabilize distributed parameter systems by shaping their total energy, i.e., by assigning a new minimum in the desired equilibrium configuration that can be reached if a dissipative effect is introduced.},

Rudimentary concepts of finite-degree-of-freedom {H}amiltonian dynamics are reviewed, in the context of the passive advection of a scalar or tracer field by a fluid. The notions of integrability, invariant-tori, chaos, overlap criteria, and invariant-tori breakup are described in this context. Preparatory to the introduction of field theories, systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, elements of functional calculus and action principles of mechanics are reviewed. The action principle for the ideal compressible fluid is described in terms of Lagrangian or material variables. {H}amiltonian systems in terms of noncanonical variables are presented, including several examples of Eulerian or inviscid fluid dynamics. Lie group theory sufficient for the treatment of reduction is reviewed. The reduction from Lagrangian to Eulerian variables is treated along with Clebsch variable decompositions. Stability in the canonical and noncanonical {H}amiltonian contexts is described. Sufficient conditions for stability, such as Rayleigh-like criteria, are seen to be only sufficient in the general case because of the existence of negative-energy modes, which are possessed by interesting fluid equilibria. Linearly stable equilibria with negative energy modes are argued to be unstable when nonlinearity or dissipation is added. The energy-Casimir method is discussed and a variant of it that depends upon the notion of dynamical accessibility is described. The energy content of a perturbation about a general fluid equilibrium is calculated using three methods. [S0034-6861(98)00102-0] CONTENTS},

Since then a number of connections with combinatorics, finitedimensional integrable {H}amiltonian systems, more general symplectic actions, and topology have flourished.

  abstract      = {This work proposes a structure-preserving model reduction method for marginally stable linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In contrast to Lyapunov-stability-based approaches---which ensure the poles of the reduced system remain in the open left-half plane---the proposed method preserves marginal stability by reducing the subsystem with poles on the imaginary axis in a manner that ensures those poles remain purely imaginary. In particular, the proposed method decomposes a marginally stable LTI system into (1) an asymptotically stable subsystem with eigenvalues in the open left-half plane and (2) a pure marginally stable subsystem with a purely imaginary spectrum. We propose a method based on inner-product projection and the Lyapunov inequality to reduce the first subsystem while preserving asymptotic stability. In addition, we demonstrate that the pure marginally stable subsystem is a generalized {H}amiltonian system; we then propose a method based on symplectic projection to reduce this subsystem while preserving pure marginal stability. In addition, we propose both inner-product and symplectic balancing methods that balance the operators associated with two quadratic energy functionals while preserving asymptotic and pure marginal stability, respectively. We formulate a geometric perspective that enables a unified comparison of the proposed inner-product and symplectic projection methods. Numerical examples illustrate the ability of the method to reduce the dimensionality of marginally stable LTI systems while retaining accuracy and preserving marginal stability; further, the resulting reduced-order model yields a finite infinite-time energy, which arises from the pure marginally stable subsystem.},

@article{Ross2016,
  abstract  = {Soft robots are machines, and like all machines their function is to convert energy from one form into another to perform tasks. One key figure of merit for machines is their efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of taskoriented work out to total energy in. All soft robots convert stored energy (from e.g., batteries, pressurized gas, chemicals) into task-oriented work (picking up objects, locomoting, jumping). These systems are complex hybrids of chemical, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, and electrical components. This complexity makes it difficult to analyze and measure their total efficiency and to identify the sources of energy loss between chemical, electrical, and mechanical domains. As the field of soft robotics matures, the design-flow process will shift from one in which building is central to one in which simulation takes precedence. That is, there is a shift from an empirical experimental methodology toward a well-characterized engineering workflow. At this point, questions such as ''For how long will this robot run on a 2000 mAh battery?'' will need to be answered, and predictive capabilities will become paramount as designers need to understand: (1) the large-scale deformations inherent to soft robotic systems; and (2) the transduction of energy in these complex, dissipative, systems to enable them to design an efficient and a well-controlled system. In this perspective piece, we discuss one possible predictive approach: a framework that uses port-based modeling. This approach uses bond-graphs and the recently developed port-{H}amiltonian theory to provide a step-by-step system for analyzing hybrid, multidomain, soft robotic systems. We discuss how this framework could be applied to controlling and optimizing soft robotic systems for energy efficiency, thereby increasing their utility. An energy-based approach is useful as a domain-free linker in analyzing complex systems; the use of ports promotes a clear distinction between energy conservation and dissipation and facilitates the analysis of efficiency. In addition, the parallels with hardware description languages and object-oriented programming will make it easier for engineers to design, for soft robots, control systems that optimize for efficiency.},

  abstract      = {This work presents a nonintrusive physics-preserving method to learn reduced-order models (ROMs) of {H}amiltonian systems. Traditional intrusive projection-based model reduction approaches utilize symplectic Galerkin projection to construct {H}amiltonian reduced models by projecting Hamilton's equations of the full model onto a symplectic subspace. This symplectic projection requires complete knowledge about the full model operators and full access to manipulate the computer code. In contrast, the proposed {H}amiltonian operator inference approach embeds the physics into the operator inference framework to develop a data-driven model reduction method that preserves the underlying symplectic structure. Our method exploits knowledge of the {H}amiltonian functional to define and parametrize a {H}amiltonian ROM form which can then be learned from data projected via symplectic projectors. The proposed method is `gray-box' in that it utilizes knowledge of the {H}amiltonian structure at the partial differential equation level, as well as knowledge of spatially local components in the system. However, it does not require access to computer code, only data to learn the models. Our numerical results demonstrate {H}amiltonian operator inference on a linear wave equation, the cubic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, and a nonpolynomial sine-Gordon equation. Accurate long-time predictions far outside the training time interval for nonlinear examples illustrate the generalizability of our learned models.},

  abstract  = {The balance of pseudomomentum is discussed and applied to simple elasticity, ideal fluids, and the mechanics of inextensible rods and sheets. A general framework is presented in which the simultaneous variation of an action with respect to position, time, and material labels yields bulk balance laws and jump conditions for momentum, energy, and pseudomomentum. The example of simple elasticity of space-filling solids is treated at length. The pseudomomentum balance in ideal fluids is shown to imply conservation of vorticity, circulation, and helicity, and a mathematical similarity is noted between the evaluation of circulation along a material loop and the J-integral of fracture mechanics. Integration of the pseudomomentum balance, making use of a prescription for singular sources derived by analogy with the continuous form of the balance, directly provides the propulsive force driving passive reconfiguration or locomotion of confined, inhomogeneous elastic rods. The conserved angular momentum and pseudomomentum are identified in the classification of conical sheets with rotational inertia or bending energy.},

  abstract  = {With this contribution, we give a complete and comprehensive framework for modeling the dynamics of complex mechanical structures as port-{H}amiltonian systems. This is motivated by research on the potential of lightweight construction using active load-bearing elements integrated into the structure. Such adaptive structures are of high complexity and very heterogeneous in nature. port-{H}amiltonian systems theory provides a promising approach for their modeling and control. Subsystem dynamics can be formulated in a domain-independent way and interconnected by means of power flows. The modular approach is also suitable for robust decentralized control schemes. Starting from a distributed-parameter port-{H}amiltonian formulation of beam dynamics, we show the application of an existing structure-preserving mixed finite element method to arrive at finite-dimensional approximations. In contrast to the modeling of single bodies with a single boundary, we consider complex structures composed of many simple elements interconnected at the boundary. This is analogous to the usual way of modeling civil engineering structures which has not been transferred to port-{H}amiltonian systems before. A block diagram representation of the interconnected systems is used to generate coupling constraints which leads to differential algebraic equations of index one. After the elimination of algebraic constraints, systems in input-state-output (ISO) port-{H}amiltonian form are obtained. port-{H}amiltonian system models for the considered class of systems can also be constructed from the mass and stiffness matrices obtained via conventional finite element methods. We show how this relates to the presented approach and discuss the differences, promoting a better understanding across engineering disciplines. A Matlab framework is available on http://github.com/awarsewa/ph_fem/ to facilitate the application of the methods to different problems.},

  abstract      = {We discuss balanced truncation model order reduction for large-scale quadratic-bilinear (QB) systems. Balanced truncation for linear systems mainly involves the computation of the Gramians of the system, namely reachability and observability Gramians. These Gramians are extended to a general nonlinear setting in Scherpen (1993), where it is shown that Gramians for nonlinear systems are the solutions of state-dependent nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Therefore, they are not only difficult to compute for large-scale systems but also hard to utilize in the model reduction framework. In this paper, we propose algebraic Gramians for QB systems based on the underlying Volterra series representation of QB systems and their Hilbert adjoint systems. We then show their relations with a certain type of generalized quadratic Lyapunov equation. Furthermore, we present how these algebraic Gramians and energy functionals relate to each other. Moreover, we characterize the reachability and observability of QB systems based on the proposed algebraic Gramians. This allows us to find those states that are hard to control and hard to observe via an appropriate transformation based on the Gramians. Truncating such states yields reduced-order systems. Additionally, we present a truncated version of the Gramians for QB systems and discuss their advantages in the model reduction framework. We also investigate the Lyapunov stability of the reduced-order systems. We finally illustrate the efficiency of the proposed balancing-type model reduction for QB systems by means of various semi-discretized nonlinear partial differential equations and show its competitiveness with the existing moment-matching methods for QB systems.},

Instead, an offline training procedure is proposed that allows to determine a sort of response surface that characterizes the response of the robot. Contrarily to existing strategies, the proposed methodology allows for a fully non-linear modeling of the soft material in a hyperelastic setting as well as a fully non-linear kinematic description of the movement without any restriction nor simplifying assumption.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to identify second-order systems, having internal Rayleigh damping. This means that the damping matrix is given as a linear combination of the mass and stiffness matrices. These systems typically appear when performing various engineering studies, e.g., vibrational and structural analysis. In an experimental setup, the frequency response of a system can be measured via various approaches, for instance, by measuring the vibrations using an accelerometer. As a consequence, given frequency samples, the identification of the underlying system relies on rational approximation. To that aim, we propose an identification of the corresponding second-order system, extending the Loewner framework for this class of systems. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by means of various numerical benchmarks.},

  abstract  = {In rigid robotics, self-collision are usually avoided since it leads to a failure in the robot control and can also cause damage. In soft robotics, the situation is very different, and selfcollisions may even be a desirable property, for example to gain artificial stiffness or to provide a natural limitation to the workspace. However, the modeling and simulation of self-collision is very costly as it requires first a collision detection algorithm to detect where collisions occur, and most importantly, it requires solving a constrained problem to avoid interpenetrations. When the number of contact points is large, this computation slows down the simulation dramatically. In this letter, we apply a numerical method to alleviate the contact response computation by reducing the contact space in a low-dimensional positive space obtained from experiments. We show good accuracy while speeding up dramatically the simulation. We apply the method in simulation on a cable-actuated finger and on a continuum manipulator performing exploration. We also show that the reduced contact method proposed can be used for inverse modeling. The method can therefore be used for control or design.},

This paper should invert this idea. The proposed methodology offers the possibility to dramatically reduce the size and the online computation time of a finite element model (FEM) of a soft robot. After a set of expensive offline simulations based on the whole model, we apply snapshot-proper orthogonal decomposition to sharply reduce the number of state variables of the soft-robot model. To keep the computational efficiency, hyperreduction is used to perform the integration on a reduced domain. The method allows to tune the error during the two main steps of complexity reduction. The method handles external loads (contact, friction, gravity, etc.) with precision as long as they are tested during the offline simulations. The method is validated on two very different examples of FEMs of soft robots and on one real soft robot. It enables acceleration factors of more than 100, while saving accuracy, in particular compared to coarsely meshed FEMs and provides a generic way to control soft robots.},

Finite element methods enable us to simulate and control soft robots, but require us to work with a large dimensional system. This limits their use in real-time simulation and makes those methods less suitable for control design tools. Using model order reduction, it is possible to create a reduced order system for building controllers and observers. Model reduction errors are taken into account in the design of the low-order feedback, and it is then applied to the large dimensional, unreduced model. The control architecture is based on a linearized model of the robot and enables the control of the robot around this equilibrium point. To show the performance of this control method, pose-to-pose and trajectory tracking experiments are conducted on a pneumatically actuated soft arm. The soft arm has 12 independent interior cavities that can be pressurized and cause the arm to move in three dimensions. The arm is made of a rubber material and is casted through a lost-wax fabrication technique.},

The two Riccati equations involved are then used to define a set of closed-loop input-output invariants called the 71, 0-characteristic values. That part of the plant or controller corresponding to 'small' %7'/-characteristic values is discarded to give a reduced-order plant or controller. By exploiting an intimate connection with coprime factorization, a simple a priori test is derived for the ability of such a reduced-order controller to stabilize the full-order plant. Furthermore, the performance of the resulting closed-loop may also be bounded a priori i.e., in terms of the prespecified level of robustness and the discarded 7-/,-characteristic values.},

The reduced model over the whole parameter space is built by combining surrogates in frequency only, built at few selected values of the parameters. This, in particular, requires matching the respective poles by solving an optimization problem. We detail how to treat unbalanced cases, where the surrogates to be combined have a different number of poles. If the frequency surrogates are constructed by minimal rational interpolation, frequency and parameters can both be sampled in a greedy fashion, by employing a fully non-intrusive "look-ahead" strategy. We explain how our proposed technique can be applied even in a high-dimensional setting, by employing locally-refined sparse grids to weaken the curse of dimensionality. Numerical examples are used to showcase the effectiveness of the method, and to highlight some of its limitations in dealing with unbalanced matching, as well as with a large number of parameters.},

In this work we propose an approach for finite element model-based control of soft robots that leverages model order reduction techniques to significantly increase computational efficiency.

  abstract      = {This work proposes a model-reduction methodology that preserves Lagrangian structure (equivalently {H}amiltonian structure) and achieves computational efficiency in the presence of high-order nonlinearities and arbitrary parameter dependence. As such, the resulting reduced-order model retains key properties such as energy conservation and symplectic timeevolution maps. We focus on parameterized simple mechanical systems subjected to Rayleigh damping and external forces, and consider an application to nonlinear structural dynamics. To preserve structure, the method first approximates the system's 'Lagrangian ingredients'-the Riemannian metric, the potential-energy function, the dissipation function, and the external force-and subsequently derives reduced-order equations of motion by applying the (forced) Euler-Lagrange equation with these quantities. From the algebraic perspective, key contributions include two efficient techniques for approximating parameterized reduced matrices while preserving symmetry and positive definiteness: matrix gappy POD and reduced-basis sparsification (RBS). Results for a parameterized truss-structure problem demonstrate the importance of preserving Lagrangian structure and illustrate the proposed method's merits: it reduces computation time while maintaining high accuracy and stability, in contrast to existing nonlinear model-reduction techniques that do not preserve structure.},

  abstract  = {The most widely used definitions of a vortex are not objective: they identify different structures as vortices in frames that rotate relative to each other. Yet a frame-independent vortex definition is essential for rotating flows and for flows with interacting vortices. Here we define a vortex as a set of fluid trajectories along which the strain acceleration tensor is indefinite over directions of zero strain. Physically, this objective criterion identifies vortices as material tubes in which material elements do not align with directions suggested by the strain eigenvectors. We show using examples how this vortex criterion outperforms earlier frame-dependent criteria. As a side result, we also obtain an objective criterion for hyperbolic Lagrangian structures.},

This paper represents a step forward in the special case where both the state equation and the control costs are quadratic. As it represents the natural extension of the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) problem, we describe this setting as the quadratic-quadratic regulator (QQR) problem. This is significantly more challenging and holds the LQR as special case that must be solved along the way. We describe an algorithm that exploits the structure of the QQR problem that arises when implementing Al'Brekht's method. This approach is amenable to feedback laws with low degree polynomials but have a relatively modest model dimension that could be achieved by modern model reduction methods. This problem has an elegant formulation and a solution that introduces several linear systems where the structure suggests modern tensor-based linear solvers. We demonstrate this algorithm on a suite of random test problems then apply it to a distributed parameter control problem that fits the QQR framework. Comparisons to linear feedback control laws show a modest benefit using the QQR formulation.},

Depending on the value of a formulation parameter, we either obtain open-loop balancing or otherwise a variety of closed-loop balancing approaches. To solve for the coefficients of the Taylor-series approximation of the energy functions, the presented method derives a linear tensor structure and heavily utilizes this to solve structured linear systems with billions of dimensions.

The nonlinear state transformation simultaneously "diagonalizes" these energy functions in the new coordinates. Since this nonlinear balancing transformation can be ill-conditioned and expensive to evaluate, we develop a computationally efficient balance-and-reduce strategy. This results in a scalable and better conditioned truncated transformation to produce balanced nonlinear ROMs and reducedorder controllers.

  abstract  = {We propose a computational approach to estimate the stability domain of quadratic-bilinear reducedorder models (ROMs), which are low-dimensional approximations of large-scale dynamical systems. For nonlinear ROMs, it is not only important to show that the origin is locally asymptotically stable, but also to quantify if the operative range of the ROM is included in the region of convergence. While accuracy and structure preservation remain the main focus of development for nonlinear ROMs, computational methods that go beyond the existing highly conservative analytical results have been lacking thus far. In this work, for a given quadratic Lyapunov function, we first derive an analytical estimate of the stability domain, which is rather conservative but can be evaluated efficiently. With the goal to enlarge this estimate, we provide an optimal ellipsoidal estimate of the stability domain by solving a convex optimization problem. This provides us with valuable information about stability properties of the ROM, an important aspect of predictive simulation. We do not assume a specific ROM method, so a particular appeal is that the approach is applicable to quadratic-bilinear models obtained via data-driven approaches, where ROM stability properties cannot-per definition-be derived from the full-order model. Numerical results for a LQG-balanced ROM of Burgers' equation, a proper orthogonal decomposition ROM of FitzHugh-Nagumo, and a non-intrusive ROM of Burgers' equation demonstrate the scalability and quantitative advantages of the proposed approach. The optimization-based estimates of the stability domain are found to be up to four orders of magnitude less conservative than analytical estimates.},

The method scales the matrix by a power of 2 to reduce the norm to order 1, computes a Padé approximant to the matrix exponential, and then repeatedly squares to undo the effect of the scaling. We give a new backward error analysis of the method (in exact arithmetic) that employs sharp bounds for the truncation errors and leads to an implementation of essentially optimal efficiency. We also give new rounding error analysis that shows the computed Padé approximant of the scaled matrix to be highly accurate. For IEEE double precision arithmetic the best choice of degree of Padé approximant turns out to be 13, rather than the 6 or 8 used by previous authors. Our implementation of the scaling and squaring method always requires at least two fewer matrix multiplications than expm when the matrix norm exceeds 1, which can amount to a 37% saving in the number of multiplications, and it is typically more accurate, owing to the fewer required squarings. We also investigate a different scaling and squaring algorithm proposed by Najfeld and Havel that employs a Padé approximation to the function x coth(x). This method is found to be essentially a variation of the standard one with weaker supporting error analysis.},

  abstract  = {Controlling soft robots with precision is a challenge due in large part to the difficulty of constructing models that are amenable to model-based control design techniques. Koopman operator theory offers a way to construct explicit linear dynamical models of soft robots and to control them using established model-based linear control methods. This method is data-driven, yet unlike other data-driven models such as neural networks, it yields an explicit control-oriented linear model rather than just a "black-box" input-output mapping. This work describes this Koopman-based system identification method and its application to model predictive controller design. A model and MPC controller of a pneumatic soft robot arm is constructed via the method, and its performance is evaluated over several trajectory following tasks in the real-world. On all of the tasks, the Koopman-based MPC controller outperforms a benchmark MPC controller based on a linear state-space model of the same system.},

This includes characterizing the mechanical behavior of soft robots, optimally controlling embedded soft actuators or active materials, and estimating the robot's state from readings of embedded sensors. Moreover, we discuss how design optimization can help to optimally place soft actuators and sensors. Recent Findings We expatiate on the adoption of simulation and optimization tools in the process of designing and controlling soft robots. We include a discussion of rigid-flexible systems and the use of differentiable simulation in combination with machine learning. Summary We review the state of the art in the computational modeling of soft robots and provide a summary of the required mathematical tools. We also review several open questions where computation could help to move the field forward, and discuss the role of differentiable simulation in managing the ever-growing design complexity of nextgeneration soft robots.},

This design solution aims to bring robots closer to invertebrate animals and soft appendices of vertebrate animals (e.g., an elephant's trunk, a monkey's tail). This work aims to introduce the control theorist perspective to this novel development in robotics. We aim to remove the barriers to entry into this field by presenting existing results and future challenges using a unified language and within a coherent framework. Indeed, the main difficulty in entering this field is the wide variability of terminology and scientific backgrounds, making it quite hard to acquire a comprehensive view on the topic. Another limiting factor is that it is not obvious where to draw a clear line between the limitations imposed by the technology not being mature yet and the challenges intrinsic to this class of robots. In this work, we argue that the intrinsic effects are the continuum or multi-body dynamics, the presence of a non-negligible elastic potential field, and the variability in sensing and actuation strategies.},

  abstract  = {A new computer haptics algorithm to be used in general interactive manipulations of deformable virtual objects is presented. In multimodal interactive simulations, haptic feedback computation often comes from contact forces. Subsequently, the fidelity of haptic rendering depends significantly on contact space modeling. Contact and friction laws between deformable models are often simplified in up to date methods. They do not allow a "realistic" rendering of the subtleties of contact space physical phenomena (such as slip and stick effects due to friction or mechanical coupling between contacts). In this paper, we use Signorini's contact law and Coulomb's friction law as a computer haptics basis. Real-time performance is made possible thanks to a linearization of the behavior in the contact space, formulated as the so-called Delassus operator, and iteratively solved by a Gauss-Seidel type algorithm. Dynamic deformation uses corotational global formulation to obtain the Delassus operator in which the mass and stiffness ratio are dissociated from the simulation time step. This last point is crucial to keep stable haptic feedback. This global approach has been packaged, implemented, and tested. Stable and realistic 6D haptic feedback is demonstrated through a clipping task experiment.},

Signorini, in 1933, proposed a physical model of contact for deformable objects interacting with rigid static bodies (Signorini, S, 1933). This paper shows that the Signorini's model extents to contacts between two deformable objects using Gauss-Seidel resolution of complementarity problems. An interactive resolution of the overall formulation is presented and experienced on deformable objects using the finite linear-elements method.},

The central contribution of this work is the use of the Finite Element Method (FEM), computed in real-time, in the control algorithm. The FEM based simulation computes the nonlinear deformations of the robots at interactive rates. The model is completed by Lagrange multipliers at the actuation zones and at the end-effector position. A reduced compliance matrix is built in order to deal with the necessary inversion of the model. Then, an iterative algorithm uses this compliance matrix to find the contribution of the actuators (force and/or position) that will deform the structure so that the terminal end of the robot follows a given position. Additional constraints, like rigid or deformable obstacles, or the internal characteristics of the actuators are integrated in the control algorithm. We illustrate our method using simulated examples of both serial and parallel structures and we validate it on a real 3D soft robot made of silicone.},

Due to the lack of precise modeling and control methods for soft robots, the promising concepts of using such design for complex applications (medicine, assistance, domestic robotics, etc.) cannot be practically implemented. This paper presents a first unified software framework dedicated to modeling, simulation, and control of soft robots. The framework relies on continuum mechanics for modeling the robotic parts and boundary conditions like actuators and contacts using a unified representation based on Lagrange multipliers. It enables the digital robot to be simulated in its environment using a direct model. The model can also be inverted online using an optimizationbased method which allows to control the physical robots in the task space. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we present various soft robots scenarios including ones where the robot is interacting with its environment. The software has been built on top of SOFA, an open-source framework for deformable online simulation and is available at https://project.inria.fr/softrobot/.},

  abstract  = {Variable length multisection continuum arms are a class of continuum robotic manipulators that generate motion by structural mechanical deformation. Unlike most continuum robots, the sections of these arms do not have (central) supporting flexible backbone, and are actuated by multiple variable length actuators. Because of the constraining nature of actuators, the continuum sections can bend and/or elongate (compress) depending on the elongation/contraction characteristics of the actuators being used. Continuum arms have a number of distinctive differences with respect to traditional rigid arms namely: smooth bending, high inherent compliance, and adaptive whole arm grasping. However, due to numerical instability and the complexity of curve parametric models, there are no spatial dynamic models for multisection continuum arms. This paper introduces novel spatial dynamics and applies these to variable length multisection continuum arms with any number of sections. An efficient recursive computational scheme for deriving the equations of motion is presented. This is applied in a general form based on structurally accurate and numerically well-posed modal kinematics that assumes circular arc deformation of continuum sections without torsion. It is shown that the proposed modal dynamics are highly scalable, producing efficient and accurate numerical results. The spatial dynamic simulation results are experimentally validated using a pneumatic muscle actuated multisection prototype continuum arm. For the first time this enables investigation of spatial dynamic effects in this class of continuum arms.},

@article{Tallec2007,
  abstract = {The present paper describes modelization and discretization issues which seem to play an important role in the numerical modeling of contact problems in solid dynamics. The first aspect concerns subscale modeling, which is crucial when dealing with frictional contact. We will see how the use of one dimensional implicit thermomechanic models resolved in a subgrid inside each boundary cell leads to practical and physically accurate solutions. This model is controlled by the average velocity of the cell, but can reproduce the detailed aspect of the temperature field and elastoplastic strains in the interface layer. The next issue concerns time discretisation scheme. The proper approximation in time of elastic and contact efforts is a major issue in order to enforce energy conservation or persistency during contact in an exact or controlled way. We review in the paper a technique proposed in [1] which treats the contact by penalty and enforces energy correction techniques to all penalty and energy terms present in the problem formulation. A last key point concerns the treatment of inertia terms. The numerical solution of a dynamic contact problem often predicts contact pressures which have spurious oscillations both in space and in time at a scale related to the discretisation grid. As described in [2], the stability of standard algorithms and the regularity of the contact pressures is improved by introducing a modified mass matrix in which the nodes in potential contact will have no mass, the corresponding mass being affected to the neighboring internal elements. One can prove that this technique guarantees the regularity in time of the space discrete solution [2], and does not affect the convergence rate in the linear case. The numerical results to be presented indicate that these schemes are surprisingly good in practice. The authors would like to thank J.P. Perlat for many helpful discussions.},

  abstract  = {Soft robots' natural dynamics calls for the development of tailored modeling techniques for control. However, the high-dimensional state space of the commonly practiced modeling approaches for soft robots, i.e. Cosserat rod and Finite Element Methods, has been identified as a key obstacle in controller design. To address this niche, Reduced-Order Modeling (ROM) and Model Order Reduction (MOR) have recently been extensively investigated. Although these techniques serve a similar purpose, they are radically different in their assumptions and implementation. This review paper provides the first in-depth comparison of ROM and MOR techniques to aid Soft Robotics researchers in selecting computationally efficient models.},

The effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed controllers have been analyzed both for the constant and the time-varying disturbances.

@article{Wehner2014,
  abstract  = {Many pneumatic energy sources are available for use in autonomous and wearable soft robotics, but it is often not obvious which options are most desirable or even how to compare them. To address this, we compare pneumatic energy sources and review their relative merits. We evaluate commercially available battery-based microcompressors (singly, in parallel, and in series) and cylinders of high-pressure fluid (air and carbon dioxide). We identify energy density (joules/gram) and flow capacity (liters/gram) normalized by the mass of the entire fuel system (versus net fuel mass) as key metrics for soft robotic power systems. We also review research projects using combustion (methane and butane) and monopropellant decomposition (hydrogen peroxide), citing theoretical and experimental values. Comparison factors including heat, effective energy density, and working pressure/flow rate are covered. We conclude by comparing the key metrics behind each technology. Battery-powered microcompressors provide relatively high capacity, but maximum pressure and flow rates are low. Cylinders of compressed fluid provide high pressures and flow rates, but their limited capacity leads to short operating times. While methane and butane possess the highest net fuel energy densities, they typically react at speeds and pressures too high for many soft robots and require extensive system-level development. Hydrogen peroxide decomposition requires not only few additional parts (no pump or ignition system) but also considerable system-level development. We anticipate that this study will provide a framework for configuring fuel systems in soft robotics.},

@article{Buza2020,
  abstract      = {Model reduction of large nonlinear systems often involves the projection of the governing equations onto linear subspaces spanned by carefully-selected modes. The criteria to select the modes relevant for reduction are usually problem-specific and heuristic. In this work, we propose a rigorous mode-selection criterion based on the recent theory of Spectral Submanifolds (SSM), which facilitates a reliable projection of the governing nonlinear equations onto modal subspaces. SSMs are exact invariant manifolds in the phase space that act as nonlinear continuations of linear normal modes. Our criterion identifies critical linear normal modes whose associated SSMs have locally the largest curvature. These modes should then be included in any projection-based model reduction as they are the most sensitive to nonlinearities. To make this mode selection automatic, we develop explicit formulas for the scalar curvature of an SSM and provide an open-source numerical implementation of our mode-selection procedure. We illustrate the power of this procedure by accurately reproducing the forced-response curves on three examples of varying complexity, including high-dimensional finite element models.},

  abstract      = {We propose a unified approach to nonlinear modal analysis in dissipative oscillatory systems. This approach eliminates conflicting definitions, covers both autonomous and time-dependent systems, and provides exact mathematical existence, uniqueness and robustness results. In this setting, a nonlinear normal mode (NNM) is a set filled with small-amplitude recurrent motions: a fixed point, a periodic orbit or the closure of a quasiperiodic orbit. In contrast, a spectral submanifold (SSM) is an invariant manifold asymptotic to a NNM, serving as the smoothest nonlinear continuation of a spectral subspace of the linearized system along the NNM. The existence and uniqueness of SSMs turns out to depend on a spectral quotient computed from the real part of the spectrum of the linearized system. This quotient may well be large even for small dissipation, thus the inclusion of damping is essential for firm conclusions about NNMs, SSMs and the reduced-order models they yield.},

  abstract  = {This paper concerns heteroclinic connections and resonance transitions in the planar circular 
               restricted 3-body problem, with applications to the dynamics of comets and asteroids and the design 
               of space missions such as the Genesis Discovery Mission and low energy Earth to Moon transfers. 
               The existence of a heteroclinic connection between pairs of equal energy periodic orbits around two of 
               the libration points is shown numerically. This is applied to resonance transition and the construction 
               of orbits with prescribed itineraries. Invariant manifold structures are relevant for transport between 
               the interior and exterior Hill’s regions, and other resonant phenomena throughout the solar system.},

I like the choice of topics and the format: a sequence of lectures. Each chapter (or lecture) carefully builds upon the material presented in previous chapters, providing new concepts in a very clear manner. Exercises at the end of each chapter reinforce the concepts, and in some cases introduce new ones. ...The emphasis is on the mathematics behind the algorithms, in the understanding of why the algorithms work. ...The tent is sprinkled with examples and explanations, which keep the student focused."},

The former interpretation is widely used in optometry and the latter features in the interpolation of rotations in computer graphics. The simplicity of these two disparate interpretations belies the complexity of the corresponding rotations. Using a quaternion representation for a rotation, we present a simple proof of the equivalence of the aforementioned characterizations and a straightforward method to establish features of the corresponding rotations.},

  abstract  = {We consider the model problem of an elastic beam vibrating between two stops. More precisely the beam is clamped at its left end while its right end may undergo contact and collision events with two stops. We model the interaction between the beam and the stops either with Signorini complementarity conditions when the stops are perfectly rigid or with a normal compliance contact law allowing some penetration within the stops and given by a linear relationship between the shear stress and the penetration at some positive power β when contact occurs. Motivated by computational issues we study the evolution of the energy functional defined as the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy of elastic deformation of the beam. When contact is modelled with a normal compliance law we prove an energy conservation property. Then we interpret the relationship between the shear stress and the penetration in case of contact as a penalization of the non-penetration condition. We show that the solutions of the penalized problems converge to a strong solution of the problem with Signorini conditions as defined in [26] and we prove that the limit satisfies an energy conservation property through instantaneaous collision events.},

While there are many established approaches to solve these in case of small-scale dense coefficients, there is no approach available to compute solutions in the large-scale sparse setting. In this paper, we develop an iterative method to compute low-rank approximations of stabilizing solutions of large-scale sparse continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations with indefinite quadratic terms. We test the developed approach for dense examples in comparison to other established matrix equation solvers, and investigate the applicability and performance in large-scale sparse examples.},

The advantage of the new algorithm is in its immediate and efficient low-rank formulation, which is a generalization of the Cholesky-factored variant of the Lyapunov ADI method. We discuss important implementation aspects of the algorithm, such as reducing the use of complex arithmetic and shift selection strategies. We show that there is a very tight relation between the new algorithm and three other algorithms for CARE previously known in the literature-all of these seemingly different methods in fact produce exactly the same iterates when used with the same parameters: they are algorithmically different descriptions of the same approximation sequence to the Riccati solution.},
